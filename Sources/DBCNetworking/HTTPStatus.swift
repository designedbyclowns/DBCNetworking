/**
 Represents an HTTP response status.

 HTTP status codes are extensible.  HTTP clients are not required to understand the meaning of all registered
 status codes, though such understanding is obviously desirable.

 However, a client _must_ understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first digit, and treat
 an unrecognized status code as being equivalent to the x00 status code of that class, with the exception that
 a recipient _must not_ cache a response with an unrecognized status code.

 > See… [RFC 7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-6).
